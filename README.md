**Introduction:**
  Authentication is a process of validating a user by getting credential details which the user only knows. By which organizattion can provide details or services for the beneficiary of the user. There are many types of Auth system that were used from the era of computer's. But for every authentication there might be a loop which could lead to Access Control over the user's account or service. This will make a impact on privacy of the user and security of the organization. Due to improper authentication system, attacks like password or pin cracking, phishing, zero-day vulnerablity, etc..! are occurring in day-to-day life. So, Many alternative ideas have been developed by the organization to ensure the security and privacy of the end user. Some new authentication system's are based on biometrics, genetical, heart beat scanner authentication systems.
  
  Authentication systems like biometrics are validated without crendialal but validadted by users unique finger prints and retina. Each Human have a unique fingerprint and retina Which can be used as crendential's for the user's. there are also many bimetrics auth like Voice fingerprinting, Face recognition.
  
 **Problem Statement:**
  "Authentication measures of Caller ID / PIN (personal identification numbers) / Security Questions / Device Signatures are sometime inadequate and intrusive. Identify creative methods of Customer Authentication which can be used on various channels. This should be done without deteriorating the customer experience."
  
  By the above problem statement we came to the conclusion that Called ID/ PIN / Security Quetions / Device Signature are In-secure in modern Authentication system. And these are sometimes can be deteriorating to the customers experience.
